This is a react online blog project that allow users to create posts and perform CRUD functions. Also there are other features like:
1. User registration
2. User Login and authentication
3. Like and dislike of posts
4. Adding to favorites
5. User dashboard showing profile, posts, settings etc
6. And many more

7. I use react context for state management and used features like react cookies, JWT tokens for authentication.

8. For the backend, I used Postgresql for the database and used expressjs alongside the react package pg pool for querying the database.
